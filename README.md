Learning github via https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
Started off many years ago learning C, C++, and Java before abandoning them to raise a family. Maintined my sanity as a Unix admin/engineer and migrated to a network engineering role some years after. Am currently a Network Consultant for a mega-corporation. Recently (within the last 6 months) picked up Python as a challenge and am continuing to expand on that knowledge base. Stopped for a bit to learn javascript/html/cs to support a team tool after the owner retired. Contining with Python now as I have started the Cisco DevNet track and am loving it. Also looking to expand my automation knowledge with the many tools avaiable for other networking platforms (Plexxi, Aruba, Arista, and so on.) 
I also love studying Austrian and Chicago economics along with fish tacos.
